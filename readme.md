# watrkit v2
yea this is the second interation because the first one sucked.

this project supports up to php 8.0 (because dependencies aren't fully updated) unless you're willing to ignore deprecation notices or fix it yourself

# Setup
configure .env-example and rename it to .env

install composer and run
`composer install`

that's all for now, this is a really early version so don't expect much.
